# AxesNav_HMI
In ScreenCraft Hackathon 2024, we had to design an innovative compound object which can be reused in many industries. I present AxesNav, which we designed using an unreleased software called EcoStruxure Operator Terminal 4.0.
## To use this compound object:
### Step 1:
Download the .vxdz file
### Step 2:
Open it using EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert 4.0.
### Step 3:
In EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert 4.0, import this project and then enjoy!
